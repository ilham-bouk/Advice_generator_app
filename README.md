## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid CSS
- Desktop-first workflow
- Fitch API

### What I learned

This challenge provided valuable practice for my coding skills, Especially since I don't used fitch api for a long time.

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  fetch(apiUrl)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((response) => {
      // console.log(response);
      let data = response.slip;
      advNum.innerHTML = data.id;
      advQuote.innerHTML = data.advice;
    }).catch(error => console.error(error));
})
``` 

### Continued development
